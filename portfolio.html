<h1>About Me</h1>
	<div id="carmel"><img src="assets/images/carmel.jpg" a="carmel"></div>
	<section id="bio">After earning a Bachelor of Science in Supply Chain and Logistics Technology with two minors: Purchasing and Organizational Leadership & Supervision, I have ventured into the realm of specialized taxes at a national tax advisory firm called alliantgroup. During this experience, I have helped managed a heavy volume of studies, leading to single deductions of over one million dollars for our clients. Previously, I interned at DHL Supply Chain where I controlled Bayer Cropscience’s daily freight operations as well as audited Bayer’s carriers’ invoices. As a student, I was involved in many organizations relating to supply chain management and logistics and volunteered my time to promote the Center for Logistics and Transportation Policy as a student ambassador. In my free time, I play as a violist in the Houston Sinfonietta and enjoy having my take at amature photography. Please enjoy my collection of photos from my most recent trip!</section>
